General Introduction to Blockchain Technology

Blockchain is an especially promising and revolutionary technology because it helps to reduce security risks, eliminate fraud, and bring transparency to a scale that has never been seen before. It was originally associated with cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) in the 2010s, but blockchain technology has since evolved into a management solution for all types of global industries. With blockchain technology, you can provide transparency for food supply chains, secure healthcare data, innovate gaming, and generally change how we handle data and ownership.

Consensus:

All participating nodes in the networks must agree in the validity of an transaction.

Provenance:

All participating nodes in the network must agree on the validity of a transaction. All the participants in the network can know the lineage of an asset recorded on the blockchain.

Immutability:

It is impossible to tamper with any transaction on the blockchain. If any transaction is wrongly executed, a new transaction must be issued to right the wrongs of the previous transaction.

Security:

The blockchain network is a peer-to-peer distributed network. There is no single point of failure. If some of the nodes fail to work, that will not affect the functioning of the network. No single authority can control the whole network. The security of the transactions is achieved through public key cryptography. Every network participant has public and private keys to encrypt the data and issue digital signatures.

Blockchain Technology in smart contracts :

                           The smart contract is a computer program based on transaction protocol that exists the term of a contract.
   Smart contract allow the execution of program without the intervention of any third party.   The scale of goods and service can be realized through transaction cryptically signed by the seller and purchaser,and joining a smart contract for scale transaction.
